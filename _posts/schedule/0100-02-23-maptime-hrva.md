Join us in our effort to provide data for the Afghanistan earthquake relief teams in our OpenStreetMap Mapathon! This is meant to be a fun, social event, but for a good cause. Refreshments will be served, including pizza, and no previous GIS experience is required.
Location: Willam & Mary Center for Geospatial Analysis, 2nd floor Swem Library
