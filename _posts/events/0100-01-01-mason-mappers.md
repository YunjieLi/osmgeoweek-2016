On Friday, November 18th, George Mason University’s Mason Mappers and Geography and Geoinformation Department will host a Mapathon where mappers will choose from various impactful mapping projects that create open data to help the humanitarian and development community. We will be able to share the work we accomplish and look at each other’s mapping contribution. The mapping events are supported by Missing Maps, NOVA Community College ASPRS club, George Mason University ASPRS club, Peace Corps, National Geographic, and MapGive.

Come show your Patriot Pride from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm in Exploratory Hall, 2301 (Open Area). More details coming soon!
